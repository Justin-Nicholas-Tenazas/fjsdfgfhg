        <h2>Facts!</h2>
        <h3>Did you know:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>> BigHit Entertainment was a small company at first, but BTS blew them up to become one of the new "Big 3" in the entertainment industry.</li>
        <li>> Originally, BTS was supposed to be a hip-hop and rap-focused group only.</li>
        <li>> Before debut, the members already featured on some music videos for BigHit's other artists (like in one of Jo Kwon's music videos) and had an interest in music and dance (j-hope was part of NEURON, a dance crew, and SUGA was already producing beats for Daegu's underground rappers).</li>
        <li>> Their first daesang (or grand award) was with their comeback album "The Most Beautiful Moment in Life pt. 1", featuring tracks like "I NEED U", "DOPE", and "Boyz with Fun".</li>
        <li>> They have their own universe, the BTS universe, where some of their M/Vs take place, and the events shown in the videos, along with the depth and symbolism of the lyrics, speaks out to the younger generation.</li>
        <li>> Their first "all-kills" (#1 on all Korean charts) were with their album "WINGS" and the songs "Blood, Sweat, and Tears" and "Spring Day".</li>
        <li>> After releasing their hit single "DNA", they performed it live at the American Music Awards, or the AMAs.</li>
        <li>> They would then go on to perform on many more American shows with top tracks like "FAKE LOVE" and "IDOL".</li>
        <li>> In 2019, the group released a hit song that many ARMYs would love for a long time: Boy With Luv feat. Halsey, on the Map of the Soul: Persona EP.</li>
        <li>> After the success of 2019, BTS released a continuation of the Persona album in early 2020, which was the Map of the Soul: 7 album.</li>
        <li>> In this pandemic, they've released a few English hit singles, which are Dynamite, Butter, and Permission to Dance.</li>
        <li>> They've also collaborated with Coldplay on the recently released song "My Universe".</li>
        </ul>
